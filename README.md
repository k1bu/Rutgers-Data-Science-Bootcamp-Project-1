Using a dataset of Seattle library book checkouts, we plan on analyzing the books checked out over last several years to see the most popular genres, most popular publishers, most popular authors, the type of materials being checked out, digital vs. physical, etc.  The dataset includes multiple years so we'll be also looking at year over year changes.
