Using a dataset of Seattle library book checkouts, we plan on analyzing the books checked out over last several years to see the most popular genres, most popular publishers, most popular authors, the type of materials being checked out, digital vs. physical, etc.  The dataset includes multiple years so we'll be also looking at year over year changes.       
 



Other data analyses to consider:
Creator with highest % of checkouts of all books ever created.  An outer join of all books from inception to current.
Correlation between material type over time.
Correlation between subject and month of year.
Correlation between volume of checkouts and time of year.
Correlation between changes in age population of Seattle over time and subjects check out over same time frame. Use census data.
Inventory management; possible books lost or destroyed.  High volume checkout, then immediate dropoff.
Inventory management; for books that have been checked out in so many years, pull from shelves.
